h2. Intro

*git-friendly* is a collection of shell scripts for automating common git workflows. The goal is to make pulling, branching, and merging fast and painless.

Git is super powerful but often requires typing 2 or 3 commands just to do some super basic tasks. This package adds some new commands: *pull*, *push*, *branch* and *merge* -- which are just wrappers around a few underlying git commands + callbacks

These commands have some bonus niceties like:
* *push* also copies a GitHub compare URL to your clipboard for easy pasting (!)
* *pull* will run commands like "bundle install" after finishing
* *branch* will setup both local & remote branches as needed
* relevant commands will stash/pop changes as needed
* less time fighting git = more time actually doing work

h2. Install

Run this one-liner, which will checkout the latest code & unpack the scripts into @/usr/local/bin@
If you don't have write access to @/usr/local/bin@ you'll need to run this using 'sudo'

pre. bash < <( curl https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/raw/master/install.sh)

You can also provide a directory to install as an argument, e.g. @/usr/bin@ instead of @/usr/local/bin@:

pre. bash < <( curl https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/raw/master/install.sh /usr/bin)

h2. Advanced Install

In case you want to keep things out of @/usr/local/bin@. Checkout the code:

pre. git clone git://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly.git ~/dev/git-friendly

Then add this directory to your PATH:

pre. export PATH=~/dev/git-friendly:$PATH

Add the above to your @~/.bash_profile@ or @~/.bashrc@ so that it runs each time you launch a new terminal.

h2. Usage

You now have some awesome new commands available: *pull*, *push*, *branch*, *merge*

Approximate workflow:

pre. $ pull
$ branch awesomeness
$ echo "BUMP" >> README
$ git commit -a -m "Righteous bump"
$ branch master
$ merge awesomeness
$ push



h2. Commands

_Primary_

| *pull* | Stash any local changes, pull from remote using rebase, updates submodules, pops your stash, then runs `bundle install` and/or `npm install` if necessary |
| *push* | Push your changes to the remote + copy a sexy diff URL like "http://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4":http://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4 to your clipboard (works on Mac and Linux) |
| *branch&nbsp;[name]* | Switch branches or create new local and/or remote branches as needed. Intelligently sets up remote tracking so you can just type 'git pull' and not always 'git pull origin newbranch'. If no argument specified will list all local & remote branches.  |
| *merge&nbsp;[name]* | Merge the specified branch into the current branch. Rebases first if the branch is local-only |

h2. Bonus: Pimp Your Configs

I strongly recommend making some basic upgrades to your ~/.gitconfig to add chill features like ANSI color, command aliases like "git st" instead of "git status", automatic remote tracking & more. Check out "my ~/.gitconfig":https://gist.github.com/668161

I also recommend adding the current git branch to your Terminal prompt (PS1) or you'll quickly lose your mind -- here is my "pimp_prompt() for bash":https://gist.github.com/790086 which goes in your @~/.bash_profile@ or @~/.bashrc@. Then type @source ~/.bashrc@ to reload.
