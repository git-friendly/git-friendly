h2. Intro

*git-friendly* is a collection of shell scripts for automating basic git workflows I find myself typing over and over again.

The goal is to make pulling, branching & merging fast and painless.

Git is super powerful but forces you to type 2 or 3 commands just to do some super basic tasks. This package adds some new commands: *pull*, *push*, *branch* and *merge* -- which are just wrappers around a few git commands & other callbacks

These commands have some bonus niceties like:
* *push* also copies a GitHub compare URL to your clipboard for easy pasting (!)
* *pull* will run commands like "bundle install" after finishing
* *branch* will setup both local & remote branches as needed
* relevant commands will stash/pop changes as needed
* less time fighting git = more time actually doing work

h2. Install

Run this one-liner, which will checkout the latest code & unpack the scripts into @/usr/local/bin@
If you don't have write access to @/usr/local/bin@ you'll need to run it as a user who does, eg. root.

pre. bash < <( curl https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/raw/master/install.sh)

h2. Advanced Install

In case you want to keep things out of @/usr/local/bin@. Checkout the code:

pre. git clone git://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly.git ~/dev/git-friendly

Then add this directory to your PATH:

pre. export PATH=~/dev/git-friendly:$PATH

Add this to your @~/.bash_profile@ so that it runs each time you launch a new shell: 

pre. echo "export PATH=~/dev/git-friendly:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

h2. Usage

You now have some awesome new commands: *pull*, *push*, *branch*, *merge*

Approximate workflow:

pre. $ pull
$ branch awesomeness
$ echo "BUMP" >> README
$ git commit -a -m "Righteous bump"
$ git checkout master
$ merge awesomeness
$ push



h2. Commands

_Primary_

| *pull* | Stash any local changes, pull from remote using rebase, pops your stash, and re-bundles if necessary |
| *push* | Push your changes to the remote + copy a sexy diff URL like "http://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4":http://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4 to your clipboard. This only works on Macs, but boy is it sweet. |
| *branch&nbsp;[name]* | Switch branches or create new local and/or remote branches as needed. Intelligently sets up remote tracking, so you can just type 'git pull' and not always 'git pull origin newbranch'. If no argument specified will list all local & remote branches.  |
| *merge&nbsp;[name]* | Merge the specified branch back into master. Rebases first if the branch is local-only |

h2. Bonus: Pimp Your Configs

I strongly recommend making some basic upgrades to your ~/.gitconfig to add chill features like ANSI color, command shortcuts, rebase-by-default, automatic remote tracking & more. Example: "my ~/.gitconfig":https://gist.github.com/668161

I also highly recommend adding the current git branch to your Terminal prompt (PS1) or you'll quickly lose your mind -- here is "pimp_prompt() for bash":https://gist.github.com/790086 which goes in your @~/.bash_profile@ or @~/.bashrc@. Then type @source ~/.bashrc@ to reload.
