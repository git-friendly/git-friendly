A collection of shell scripts for making **pulling**, **branching**, and **merging** with Git fast and painless.

Git sometimes requires typing two or three commands just to execute something basic like fetching new code. git-friendly adds a few new commands — pull, push, branch, merge which:

* stash/pop changes as needed
* less time fighting Git = more time actually doing work
* **push** also copies a GitHub compare URL to your clipboard for easy pasting
* **pull** will run commands like `bundle install`, `npm install`, `yarn install`, and `composer install` if necessary
* **branch** will track remote branches if they are available


## Install

Run this one-liner, which will checkout the latest code and unpack the scripts into `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiew/git-friendly/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Note:** If you don’t have write access to `/usr/local/bin` you'll need to run this using `sudo`.

You can also specify a directory to install:

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamiew/git-friendly/master/install.sh | bash -s ~/friendly
```

## Manual Install

Checkout the code:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly.git ~/dev/git-friendly
```

Then add this directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=~/dev/git-friendly:$PATH
```

Add the above to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` so that it runs each time you launch a new terminal.

## Usage

You now have new awesome commands: **pull**, **push**, **branch**, **merge**:

Example session:

```bash
$ pull
$ branch awesomeness
$ echo "BUMP" >> README
$ git commit -a -m "Righteous bump"
$ branch master
$ merge awesomeness
$ push
```


## Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `pull` | Stash any local changes, pull from remote using rebase, updates submodules, pop your stash, then run `bundle install`, `npm install`, `yarn install`, `bower install` or `composer install` if necessary. |
| `push` | Push your changes to the remote + copy a compare URL, like [https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4](https://github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/compare/e96033...5daed4), to your clipboard (works on Mac and Linux). |
| `branch [name]` | Switch branches or create new local branch if it doesn’t exist. Intelligently sets up remote branch tracking so you can just type `git pull` and not always `git pull origin newbranch`. If no argument specified, will list all local and remote branches. Supports branch deletion with `-d` or `-D` keys. |
| `merge [name]` | Merge the specified branch into the current branch. Rebases first if the branch is local-only. |


## Configuration

You can disable `bundle install`, `npm install`, `yarn install`, `bower install` and `composer install` for the `pull` command by defining environmental variables:

* `GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_BUNDLE`: disables `bundle install`
* `GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_NPM`: disables `npm install`
* `GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_YARN`: disables `yarn install`
* `GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_BOWER`: disables `bower install`
* `GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_COMPOSER`: disables `composer install`

For example, add this line to your `~/.bash_profile` to disable `bundle install`:

```bash
export GIT_FRIENDLY_NO_BUNDLE=true
```


## Bonus: Pimp Your Configs

We strongly recommend editing your global `~/.gitconfig` and adding features like ANSI color, command aliases (e.g. `git st` instead of `git status`), automatic remote tracking and more. Check out [this sample ~/.gitconfig](https://gist.github.com/668161) to get started.

We also recommend adding the current Git branch to your Terminal prompt (PS1) or you’ll quickly lose your place — here is a [pimp_prompt() bash function](https://gist.github.com/790086) which goes in your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`, then type `source ~/.bashrc` to reload.
